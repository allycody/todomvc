# React + MOBservable TodoMVC Example

> MOBservable is light-weight stand-alone library to create reactive primitives, functions, arrays and objects. Its goal is to make developers happy and productive. It loves React.

> _[MOBservable](https://github.com/mweststrate/MOBservable)_

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.

## Learning MOBservable

The examples in the documentation are probably the best place to get started.

* This [diff](https://github.com/mweststrate/todomvc/commit/2e30caeb8c690c914f92081ac01d12097a068a1e) shows the difference with vanilla ReactJS (using immutable data structures) and ReactJS + MOBservable
* [MOBservable readme with examples](https://github.com/mweststrate/MOBservable/blob/master/README.md)
* [Philosophy and in-depth analysis of MOBservable](https://www.mendix.com/tech-blog/making-react-reactive-pursuit-high-performing-easily-maintainable-react-apps/)

_If you have any questions or issues concerning this example of MOBservable in general, just file an issue at the [github repo](https://github.com/mweststrate/MOBservable/issues)_

## Learning React

The [React getting started documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) is a great way to get started.

Here are some links you may find helpful:

* [Documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)
* [API Reference](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reference.html)

## Running

The app is built with [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and compiled at runtime for a lighter and more fun code reading experience. As stated in the link, JSX is not mandatory.

To run the app, spin up an HTTP server (e.g. `npm install -g servant && servant`) and visit http://localhost:3000
